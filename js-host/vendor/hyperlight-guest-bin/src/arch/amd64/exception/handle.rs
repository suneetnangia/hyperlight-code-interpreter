/// Handlers receive mutable pointers to the exception information and CPU context,

///
/// # Parameters
/// * `exception_number` - Exception vector number (0-30)
/// * `exception_info` - Mutable pointer to exception information (instruction pointer, error code, etc.)
/// * `context` - Mutable pointer to saved CPU context (registers, FPU state, etc.)
/// * `page_fault_address` - Page fault address (only valid for page fault exceptions)
///
/// # Returns
/// * `true` - Suppress the default abort behavior and continue execution
/// * `false` - Allow the default abort to occur
///
/// # Safety
/// This function type uses raw mutable pointers. Handlers must ensure:
/// - Pointers are valid for the duration of the handler
/// - Any modifications to exception state maintain system integrity
/// - Modified values are valid for CPU state (e.g., valid instruction pointers, aligned stack pointers)
