    // overwrite. The common practice there is to provide signal handling chaining, which
    // means that the signal is handled by all registered handlers from the last registered
    // to the first. **Hyperlight does not provide signal chaining**. For SIGSYS, this is because,
    // currently, Hyperlight handles SIGSYS signals by directly altering the instruction pointer at
    // the time the syscall occurred to call a function that will panic the host function execution.
    // For SIGRTMIN, this is because Hyperlight issues potentially 200 signals back-to-back and its
    // likely that the embedder will not want to handle this.
